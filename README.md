# 📦 Intelligent System for High-Efficiency Box Assembly – ZelioSoft2 + Factory I/O

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a smart, automated **Box Assembly and Transfer System** designed for high efficiency and precision. Using **ZelioSoft2** as the controller and simulated realistically in **Factory I/O**, this system mimics real-world automation used in modern packaging lines.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

- 📦 **Belt Conveyor** moves boxes until a sensor detects them.
- 🤖 **Palletizer** groups every 2 boxes, then pushes them forward.
- 🔄 When a group of **6 boxes** is completed:
  - The **Elevator moves up**, aligning with a **Plate**.
  - The **Plate opens**, dropping boxes to the lower level.
  - The **Elevator moves down** and transfers them to the final sensor.
  - A **Roller Conveyor** then completes the final stage of transport.
